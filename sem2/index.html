			<h1>Week 1</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				This was the first lecture for the module "Dynamic Web Authoring Client View" (COM311). The module is
				being
				co-ordinated by Dr Huiru (Jane) Zheng.

			</p>
			<p>
				This module will cover topics like web standards, accessibility and the browser object model. We will
				also look at
				client side scripting using the language "JavaScript" whereby we would like to achieve various outcomes
				such as GUI
				scripting, data collection as well as user profiling.
			</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				This week in the labs we firstly spent some time getting used to the iMacs in this lab as well as set up
				the
				connection to the Block 16 storage facilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this we then revisited some of our HTML and CSS knowledge from year 1. We were tasked to create a
				simple form
				with some inputs, check boxes, radio buttons, text input and then a submit button.

		<div id="week2">

			<h1>Week 2</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				In the lecture this week we looked at our week 1 practical and looked at some feedback Jane had for us
				moving
				forward.
				After this we began to look at XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language). XHTML was released
				initially in 2000 -
				it reformulates HTML asn an XML application. This makes it easier to process and easier to maintain. It
				is
				compatible with exisiting web browser technology and will be compaitble with future XML-based clients.

			</p>
			<p>
				Next we began looking at some accessibility standards that we should use in our web pages. Firstly, Jane
				showed us
				the W3C validator tool. This is used to check the markup of web pages input to it.
				<br>
				Web accessibility is a key feature for all websites as the Internet should be accessible by all and so
				as
				developers we need to ensure we can facilitate this.
				Some may have visibility issues, others hearing or physical/motor inabilites. This should not mean they
				cannot
				browse the web like everyone else.
				<br>
				We learned about the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content
					Accesibility
					Guidelines (WCAG)</a> and <a href="https://webaim.org/intro/">accessible design</a>.
				These outline some of the practices we should use when coding such as meaningful alt tags on pictures,
				or longdesc
				tags for screen-readers.
			</p>


			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				We spent this lab by trying out the validators provided by W3C and adding some extra features to our
				Week 1 form to
				make it more accesible. E.g. adding alt attributes and id, labels etc. to radio buttons and text entry.

		<!-- Week 3 -->
		<div id="week3">

			<h1>Week 3</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				This week we began to look at the DOM (Document Object Model) and BOM (Browser Object Model) as well as
				some
				recapping from last years JavaScript.

			</p>
			<p>

				The BOM is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser.
				DOM is a cross-platform convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML
				documents.
				Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects.

			</p>
			<p>
				We also then looked at the fundamentals of JavaScript e.g the various properties such as
				document.<i>bgColor</i>
				and the events/event handlers such as <i>onmouseover</i>

			</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript code that is inline (i.e. in the actual HTML document rather than in its own document) should
				be placed
				in the head tag and should be between script tags e.g.

				<xmp>

					<head>
						<script type="text/javascript">
					//JavaScript here
						</script>
					</head>
				</xmp>
			</p>
			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				This week in the labs we firstly began using the onmouseover/onmouseout events to create a web page that
				when you
				hover over an image the image changed. We then used the same concept
				to create some links that when hovered over would change the body background colour.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this we then looked at how variables worked and how they would change depending on the statements
				we assigned
				to the variable. For example, we looked at how a variable containing an age would update
				if we used methods like myAge == 50+10. We then did the same with a string of text instead of a number
				in the
				variable.

		<!-- Week 4 -->
		<div id="week4">

			<h1>Week 4</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				Week 4 we began to look at the jQuery library, this is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that is
				designed to change the way that you write JavaScript
			</p>
			<p>

				It offers some different functionality from plain JavaScript
				<ul>
					<li>DOM scripting & event handling</li>
					<li>Ajax</li>
					<li>User interface effects</li>
					<li>Form validation</li>
					<li>Utilities</li>
				</ul>

				It is lightweight, supports multiple browsers, has a CSS-like syntax, an active developer community
				supporting the library and is extensible.
			</p>
			<p>
				jQuery can be downloaded from the website <a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a> or it can
				be linked to from external sources such as
				<ul>
					<li><a
							href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js">https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js</a>
					</li>
					<li><a
							href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js">http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Selecting a part of the document is a fundamental part of jQuery. <br>
				a jQuery object is a wrapper for a selected group of DOM nodes <br>

				$() function is a factory method that creates JQuery objects <br>
				$(a) is a JQuery object containing all the a elements in the document
			</p>
			<p>
				A function can be created using the function command
				<xmp>
					Function doSomething(){
					var theVisitor = document.myform.visitor.value;
					Window.alert("Is this OK," + theVisitor + "?");
					}
				</xmp>
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of the lecture we had a brief look into some basic debugging techniques for JavaScript. We
				looked at
				these because our code will not always work first time and sometimes we will need some information in
				order to fix
				and ultimately deploy code.

			</p>

			<p>
				We looked at what Chrome and Firefox can help us with using the developer tools. Generally it will
				output the line
				which it discovers a problem on. This creates a good starting point for fixing errors.
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>Practical</h3>
				<p>
					The practical begins by using some of our debugging tips from the lecture to try fix an error for
					the <a href="practical4/listing1.3_error.html">listing1.3error.html</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					After this we looked at creating arrays to store some string variables and then outputting these
					variables to a
					larger string</br>
					<a href="practical4/Practical4_Q3.html">Practical4_Q3.html</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally we then created a function to display a similar message from Question 3, but instead of an
					array this time
					we utilised local variables within a function. We also attached the JavaScript as an external
					file.</br>

		<!-- Week 5 -->
		<div id="week5">

			<h1>Week 5</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				Week 5 we looked more JavaScript functions and how to access particular elements on the document object
				model.

			</p>
			<p>

				We can call functions to button click events using the onclick="myFunction()" or onload="myFunction()"
				methods
				within our HTML.

			</p>
			<p>
				To use a function we must:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Decide the function(s) of the function
				</li>
				<li>
					Understand the input and output
				</li>
				<li>
					Design the function
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure the function is relative independent </li>
						<li>Can be reused - should be generalised</li>
						<li>Easy to call</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Call a function
					<ul>
						<li>
							Directly
							<ul>
								<li>functioname(parameter1,parameter2); </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Via event handler
					<ul>
						<li>
							onclick( functioname(parameter1,parameter2);)
						</li>
						<li>onload (functionname(parameter1, parameter2);)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				A function can also be called within a function
			</p>
			<xmp>

				function add3(a,b,c){
				var addtwo = add(a,b);
				var result= add(addtwo, c);
				return result;
				}
			</xmp>

			<p>Within JavaScript we can access particular object values/property values from our HTML forms.</p>

			<p>Using object names</p>
			<p><i>var visitorname = document.myform.visitor.value;</i></p>

			<p>Using element IDs</p>
			<p><i>var visitorname = document.getElementById('visitorid').value;</i></p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				This weeks practical begins with us creating a form that includes some input types e.g. textboxes,
				dropdown menus
				and buttons.
			</p>
			<p>When the user inputs their information and clicks the button the web page will be updated to display a
				sentence
				that includes their name, university, campus and course they are studying.</p>
			<a href="practical5/Practical5_Q1.html">Practical5_Q1.html</a>
			<p>
				Next we edited our form from week 2 so that it would output the information provided into the comments
				box. To
				achieve this we had to apply what we learned in the lecture as we were required to use variables to
				select the
				specific elements within the document object models.

		<!-- Week 6 -->
		<div id="week6">

			<h1>Week 6</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>

			<p>This week we began to look at looping statements. Looping statements refers to a statement which will
				repeat code
				that is declared within its body.</p>

			<p>There are 3 types of loops: For, While and Do While.</p>
			<p>For loop - this is divided into conditions which allows for us to loop until conditions are met</p>
			<xmp>
				for (initial expr; test condition; update expr) {
				JavaScript statements;
				}
			</xmp>

			<p>While loop - this type of loop only needs a test condition for it to run so long as the condition is met
			</p>
			<xmp>
				while (condition) {
				JavaScript statements;
				}

			</xmp>

			<p>Do... While loop - This loop is similar to the While loop where in it will only work so long as the
				condition is
				met however in this case we determine the condition after the code is executed.</p>
			<xmp>
				Do {
				JavaScript statements;
				} while (condition);

			</xmp>
			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>This weeks practical consisted of putting our looping statements to work.</p>
			<p>The practical document includes 5 buttons, each button utilises a different type of loop to get the
				expected
				outcome</p>

		<!-- Week 7 -->
		<div id="week7">

			<h1>Week 7</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>This weeks practical looked into using conditional branch statements such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>if... statement</li>
				<li>if... else statement</li>
				<li>if... else if... else... statement</li>
				<li>switch statement</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All if statments use similar syntax so I will show one statment that covers all 3:</p>
			<blockquote>
				if (condition) { <br>
				statements to execute if the condition is true <br>
				} <br>
				else if (condition) { <br>
				statements to execute if the condition is true <br>
				} <br>
				else { <br>
				statements to execute if the condition is false <br>
				} <br>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A switch statement's syntax looks like:</p>
			<blockquote>
				switch (expression) {<br>
				case value_1 : <br>
				statements; <br>
				break; <br>
				case value_2 : <br>
				statements; <br>
				break; <br>
				default : <br>
				statements; <br>
				} <br>

			</blockquote>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>The first question wanted a JavaScript application to calculate the average of four marks
				using user input for marks 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was created using an if... else if... if statement.
			</p>
			<p>The application had some validation, if the user did not input a mark an alert would display asking for
				input</p>
			<a href="Practical7/practical7_q2aii.html">practical7_Q2a.html</a>

			<p>Then, we had to modify this code to use a switch statement to achieve the same result</p>

		<!-- Week 8 -->
		<div id="week8">

			<h1>Week 8</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Week 8's lecture was titled form validation and covered how to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use form validation to examine text</li>
				<li>Understand the princiuples of working with text fields</li>
				<li>Detect and change the format of information in a text field</li>
				<li>Work with radio buttons, check boxes, and selection menus</li>
				<li>Create simple, self grading tests</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are different types of form validation, including: valid email address, valid date, valid text type
				and
				leaving required fields empty</p>
			<p>We should remind the visitor to enter missing data and reformat the visitor's data as needed</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>The initial question wanted the use of loops to create a table of multiplcations, with as many
				rows/columns as
				the user wished</p>
			<a href="Practical8/practical8_q2.html">Practical8_Q2.html</a>
			<p>Then we needed to modify the script to be able to search for a specific value, and then tell the user
				which
				row/column it was situated in</p>
			<a href="Practical8/practical8_q3.html">Practical8_Q3.html</a>
			<p>Once these were complete we started building an insurance quote checker form which used the following
				criteria</p>
			<ul>
				<li>if the age is above 30 (include 30) and married, the car insurance is "class 1";</li>
				<li>if the age is above 30 (include 30) and single, the car insurance is "class 2";</li>
				<li>if the age is above 21 and below 30, married, the car insurance is "class 3"; </li>
				<li>if the age is above 21 and below 30, single, the car insurance is "class 4"; and</li>
				<li>if the age is above 17 and below 21, the car insurance is "class 5"</li>
			</ul>
			<a href="Practical8/practical8_q4.html">Practical8_Q4.html</a>

			<p>The final question asked for us to modify the script to validate the form before submitting it. To do
				this part
				of the practical
				I did some personal research into how to achieve the required validation neccessary and found you can
				use "regular
				expression"
				in JavaScript to check for things like alphabetical characters only.
			</p>
			<p>For the age, I used an input type of number so only numbers can be input - this was added in HTML5</p>

		<!-- Week 9 -->
		<div id="week9">
			<h1>Week 9</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Week 9 was set to discuss more form validation techniques such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>String methods</li>
				<li>Email validation</li>
				<li>Reformatting</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We were also notified of a class test that would take place in week 10 and include everything from weeks
				1
				through
				9</p>
			<p>Jane began with String methods where she told us about how a string can actually be considered an array.
				This is because you can select specific characters through zero-based indexing e.g.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				let myname = "Thomas Gormley";<br>
				let Ch1 = myname[0];//Ch1 = "T"
			</blockquote>
			<p>This means that we can also access other properties such as:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>length</i> to obtain the number of characters in the string
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>charAt(n)</i> which will get the character in the tring at the postion of <i>n</i>.
					</li>
					<li><i>indexOf(a character, n)</i> will show the postion of the character in the string, searching
						from the
						postion <i>n</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>substring(n1, n2)</i> method will obtain the substring of characters in the string object
						from the
						position <i>n1</i> to <i>n2</i>, not including n2
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Email validation consisted of getting the location of "@" symbol, identifying the ".", getting the length
				of the
				full email address and ensuring all the conditions should be fulfilled</p>
			<p>
				Reformatting data, for example a phone number would use steps like: getting the input string, picking up
				the
				numbers only and then an if statement containing checking for different properties of the phone number
				to then output the full number.
			</p>
			<p>We could then combine all of these functions to ensure they all return true, and so then could execute
				the main
				form
				function.</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>Our practical this week involved introducing our new validation techniques into a form we created early
				in
				semester
				1.</p>
			<p>We had to check the text input fields, radio button and checkbox input of our page. This was created
				using
				multiple
				functions that would either return true or false depending on if the user input or not correctly.
				The form had to give user friendly error messages to ensure all data required was input and thus, so we
				could
				accurately output the information again in the comments box

		<!-- Week 10 -->
		<div id="week10">
			<h1>Week 10</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>In week 10 we learned how to create an image rollover using JavaScript functions</p>
			<p>We had already created something similar earlier in the module, however this was a basic way that
				utilised the
				onmouseover/onmouseout built in HTML events</p>
			<p>A more effective rollover would preload the images into the browser's cache that could then be accessed
				by
				filling the SRC properties with our images</p>
			<p>To do this we would need to also create our rollOn/rollOff functions</p>
			<p>We also learned it would be possible to create the same effect using only one function - this was known
				as a
				double rollover function.</p>
			<p>This example would take 2 arguments, either ON/OFF and the image name</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>Due to having a lengthy class test in week 10, our practical lab was cut somewhat short.</p>
			<p>We were asked to look at the lecture notes and create a rolloff page of our own using functions</p>
			<p>I created my page using popular car manufacturers logos as the images, and if the user clicks the image
				it would
				bring them to the relevant websites</p>
			<a href="practical10/index.html">Practical10.html</a>

		<!-- Week 11 -->
		<div id="week11">
			<h1>Week 11</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>For this lecture our objective was to understand how to create captioned slideshows that can be
				controlled with
				navigation buttons and to learn how to create animated banner advertisements with links</p>
			<p>The slideshow can be created by using the DOM structure and functions to assign new images upon button
				clicks</p>
			<p>The animated banner utilised a new method called setTimeout() which would let us create a timer of sorts
				that can
				change the image after a specific timeframe. </p>
			<p>This method takes an argument in milliseconds so 1000 = 1 second</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>Our practical questions asked us to create the slideshow and animated banner we learned about earlier
				that week
				in our lecture</p>
			<p>The slideshow was just a matter of creating functions that would switch the image out depending on what
				location
				of the array we were at.</p>
			<p>We also display the current slide number to the user by changing the DOM elements in our javascript file.
			</p>
			<p>Again, we preloaded our images like the previous week to ensure optimal performance.</p>
			<a href="practical11/practical11_q1.html">Practical11_q1.html</a>

			<p>The animated banner was created using the new method we learned, <i>setTimeout()</i>. Every second, the
				image
				updates to a different logo, if the user clicks when on a specific logo it will redirect them to the
				relevant site.</p>
