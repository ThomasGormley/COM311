			<h1>Week 1</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				To keep the lecture notes and practicals in the same weeks on my learning log I have placed the actual
				week 1 lecture in week 2 with the practical to keep things neat and tidy.

			</p>
			<p>
				So for the purposes of this learning log I have no week 1 lecture.
			</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				This practical was all about revision from last semester, in this practical we created a number of basic
				web pages that did specific things.

			</p>
			<p>
				We created a web page that used a function to display the time and place of lab classes from variables
				we passed into the function. <br>
				Then we made a page that would take user input from a prompt and pass it through to the web page to
				place into a paragraph. <br>
				Next we made a password box that used an if statement to check the length of the of the user input and
				made sure it was more than 6 characters. <br>
				Finally it was a loop through of 2 images that would change. I'm not sure if my code is correct for this
				as I couldn't get it to work as intended.

		<div id="week2">

			<h1>Week 2</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				This lecture was discussing how to use the Date and Time objects in JavaScript.
			</p>
			<p>
				To create a Date object you must define a variable of type date, for example <br>
				<i>var today = new Date();</i> <br>
				Once this object is created, you can then call various methods on it for example,
				<ul>
					<li>toLocaleString</li>
					<li>toGMTString</li>
					<li>getDate</li>
					<li>getMonth</li>
					<li>getDay</li>
					<li>getFullYear</li>
					<li>getTime</li>
					<li>getHours</li>
					<li>getMinutes</li>
					<li>getSeconds</li>
					<li>getMilliseconds</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				We also looked at how to create a simple clock with the setTimeout() and the setInterval() functions.
			</p>
			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				The first question asked us to create a day checker. This would work whereby the user would type in
				their desired year, month and day and the page would tell them what day of the week this was.

			</p>
			<p>
				I was able to do this by creating a function called findDay, which would take the users input and create
				a new date object from that. Then I could use the getDay method to give me a value between 0-6 depending
				on what day it was. Using this, I created an array of the weekdays which corresponded with the number
				the JavaScript method gave me.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, I simply output the result to an empty paragraph tag.
			</p>
			<p>
				We were also asked to create a simple clock and display it at the top of the page.
			</p>
			This can be viewed at <a href="practical2/practical14_q1.html">practical2_q1.html</a>

			<p>
				Next I created a basic "reminders" web application whereby the page will notify users of certain tasks
				depending on the time of day.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, every Monday if the time is between 9-11am the user will be instruced to go to class.

			</p>

		<div id="week3">

			<h1>Week 3</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				Week 3 was introducing us to Internet cookies - these are all about maintaining state on a webpage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cookies are small pieces of information that are:
				<ul>
					<li>Sent from a website</li>
					<li>Stored on the visitors hard drive by the user's web browser</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Cookies are usesd to differentiate among users and personalise websites

				They are used to:
				<ul>
					<li>Remember stateful information (e.g. items added into a shopping cart), manage the shopping cart,
						personalise aspects of websites</li>
					<li>Record the user's browsing activity (e.g. clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording
						which pages were visited in the past) - website statistics and creation of anonymous user
						profiles</li>
					<li>Remember arbitrary pieces of information previously entered (e.g. names, addresses, passwords,
						and credit card numbers) - knows if the user is already logged in</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				This practical all about cookies allowed us to create a web form for a username/password and using the
				mylibrary.js functions to remember user input/userchoices.
			</p>
			<p>
				On load, the form asks the user to register, and if the user does put in a username/password and clicks
				remember password, then we store the information in cookies using the makeCookies() function Jane
				provided us with.
			</p>
			<p>
				This form can be seen <a href="practical3\practical15_q1.html">practical3_q1.html</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				The second form for this webpage was a background colour selector that would remember the users
				preferences using cookies. The user could reset this selection by pressing a button that would delete
				all cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I ran into some problems when developing as Google Chrome does not store cookies on local files and so I
				spent quite some time debugging before realising that was the issue - so because of this these forms
				will need to be run in Internet Explorer to work as intended.

		<!-- Week 4 -->
		<div id="week4">

			<h1>Week 4</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				Week 4 we began to look at the jQuery library, this is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that is
				designed to change the way that you write JavaScript
			</p>
			<p>

				It offers some different functionality from plain JavaScript
				<ul>
					<li>DOM scripting & event handling</li>
					<li>Ajax</li>
					<li>User interface effects</li>
					<li>Form validation</li>
					<li>Utilities</li>
				</ul>

				It is lightweight, supports multiple browsers, has a CSS-like syntax, an active developer community
				supporting the library and is extensible.
			</p>
			<p>
				jQuery can be downloaded from the website <a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a> or it can
				be linked to from external sources such as
				<ul>
					<li><a
							href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js">https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js</a>
					</li>
					<li><a
							href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js">http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Selecting a part of the document is a fundamental part of jQuery. <br>
				a jQuery object is a wrapper for a selected group of DOM nodes <br>

				$() function is a factory method that creates JQuery objects <br>
				$(a) is a JQuery object containing all the a elements in the document
			</p>

			<p>
				$ is nothing but a shorthand notation for find method in JQuery. You can also use jQuery('' '') instead
				of $('' '')
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>Practical</h3>

				<p>
					For the practical we were asked to download jQuery from <a href="jquery.com">jQuery.com</a> and the
					2 example HTML documents provided.
				</p>

				<p>Once we had looked at Jane's code and began to understand how jQuery worked, we moved onto the second
					task.</p>

				<p>
					This task was to take some more code and add our own jQuery statement to it in order to change a
					paragraph of text from "This is paragraph 1" to "Hello there" through calling a function called
					<i>"selectElement"</i> &mdash; this is a built in function to jQuery.

		<!-- Week 5 -->
		<div id="week5">

			<h1>Week 5</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				This week began with Jane telling us about our group project scenarios, and how we should go about
				creating the project e.g. what steps we should take.
			</p>

			<p>
				Then the main content for the lecture was jQuery part 2 - we looked at some more functions within
				jQuery.

				<ul>
					<li>jQuery() = $()</li>
					<li>$(function) The “Ready” handler</li>
					<li>$(‘selector’) Element selector expression</li>
					<li>$(element) Specify element(s) directly</li>
					<li>$(‘HTML’) HTML creation</li>
					<li>$.function() Execute a jQuery function</li>
					<li>$.fn.myfunc(){ } Create jQuery function</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				We were then given a large list from w3schools which contained all of the jQuery selectors.
			</p>

			<p>
				The lecture also showed us that jQuery can be used to create visual effects for example
				.slideUp("slow").
			</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>

			<p>
				The practical this week was working on improving examples from the lecture using the jQuery we learned.

			</p>
			<p>
				The first one was a counting the number of checked checkboxes using the .length method in jQuery, for
				the second question
				we then just modified this to work with select list of options rather than radio buttons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Question 3 and 4 related to 1 and 2 whereby it was modifying the code to check what the user had
				selected and e.g. tell them
				if we were on the same course (question 3) or else repeat the options they had selected (question 4).
