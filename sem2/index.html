			<p>
				Week 3 was introducing us to Internet cookies - these are all about maintaining state on a webpage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cookies are small pieces of information that are:
				<ul>
					<li>Sent from a website</li>
					<li>Stored on the visitors hard drive by the user's web browser</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Cookies are usesd to differentiate among users and personalise websites

				They are used to:
				<ul>
					<li>Remember stateful information (e.g. items added into a shopping cart), manage the shopping cart,
						personalise aspects of websites</li>
					<li>Record the user's browsing activity (e.g. clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording
						which pages were visited in the past) - website statistics and creation of anonymous user
						profiles</li>
					<li>Remember arbitrary pieces of information previously entered (e.g. names, addresses, passwords,
						and credit card numbers) - knows if the user is already logged in</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h1>Week 4</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				Week 4 we began to look at the jQuery library, this is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that is
				designed to change the way that you write JavaScript
			</p>
			<p>

				It offers some different functionality from plain JavaScript
				<ul>
					<li>DOM scripting & event handling</li>
					<li>Ajax</li>
					<li>User interface effects</li>
					<li>Form validation</li>
					<li>Utilities</li>
				</ul>

				It is lightweight, supports multiple browsers, has a CSS-like syntax, an active developer community
				supporting the library and is extensible.
			</p>
			<p>
				jQuery can be downloaded from the website <a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a> or it can
				be linked to from external sources such as
				<ul>
					<li><a
							href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js">https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js</a>
					</li>
					<li><a
							href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js">http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Selecting a part of the document is a fundamental part of jQuery. <br>
				a jQuery object is a wrapper for a selected group of DOM nodes <br>

				$() function is a factory method that creates JQuery objects <br>
				$(a) is a JQuery object containing all the a elements in the document
			</p>

			<p>
				$ is nothing but a shorthand notation for find method in JQuery. You can also use jQuery('' '') instead
				of $('' '')
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>Practical</h3>

				<p>
					For the practical we were asked to download jQuery from <a href="jquery.com">jQuery.com</a> and the
					2 example HTML documents provided.
				</p>

				<p>Once we had looked at Jane's code and began to understand how jQuery worked, we moved onto the second
					task.</p>

				<p>
					This task was to take some more code and add our own jQuery statement to it in order to change a
					paragraph of text from "This is paragraph 1" to "Hello there" through calling a function called
					<i>"selectElement"</i> &mdash; this is a built in function to jQuery.
