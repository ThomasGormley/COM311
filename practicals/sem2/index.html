			<h1>Week 1</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				To keep the lecture notes and practicals in the same weeks on my learning log I have placed the actual
				week 1 lecture in week 2 with the practical to keep things neat and tidy.

			</p>
			<p>
				So for the purposes of this learning log I have no week 1 lecture.
			</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				This practical was all about revision from last semester, in this practical we created a number of basic
				web pages that did specific things.

			</p>
			<p>
				We created a web page that used a function to display the time and place of lab classes from variables
				we passed into the function. <br>
				Then we made a page that would take user input from a prompt and pass it through to the web page to
				place into a paragraph. <br>
				Next we made a password box that used an if statement to check the length of the of the user input and
				made sure it was more than 6 characters. <br>
				Finally it was a loop through of 2 images that would change. I'm not sure if my code is correct for this
				as I couldn't get it to work as intended.

		<div id="week2">

			<h1>Week 2</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				This lecture was discussing how to use the Date and Time objects in JavaScript.
			</p>
			<p>
				To create a Date object you must define a variable of type date, for example <br>
				<i>var today = new Date();</i> <br>
				Once this object is created, you can then call various methods on it for example,
				<ul>
					<li>toLocaleString</li>
					<li>toGMTString</li>
					<li>getDate</li>
					<li>getMonth</li>
					<li>getDay</li>
					<li>getFullYear</li>
					<li>getTime</li>
					<li>getHours</li>
					<li>getMinutes</li>
					<li>getSeconds</li>
					<li>getMilliseconds</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				We also looked at how to create a simple clock with the setTimeout() and the setInterval() functions.
			</p>
			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				The first question asked us to create a day checker. This would work whereby the user would type in
				their desired year, month and day and the page would tell them what day of the week this was.

			</p>
			<p>
				I was able to do this by creating a function called findDay, which would take the users input and create
				a new date object from that. Then I could use the getDay method to give me a value between 0-6 depending
				on what day it was. Using this, I created an array of the weekdays which corresponded with the number
				the JavaScript method gave me.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, I simply output the result to an empty paragraph tag.
			</p>
			<p>
				We were also asked to create a simple clock and display it at the top of the page.
			</p>
			This can be viewed at <a href="practical2/practical14_q1.html">practical2_q1.html</a>

			<p>
				Next I created a basic "reminders" web application whereby the page will notify users of certain tasks
				depending on the time of day.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, every Monday if the time is between 9-11am the user will be instruced to go to class.

			</p>

		<!-- Week 3 -->
		<div id="week3">

			<h1>Week 3</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				Week 3 was introducing us to Internet cookies - these are all about maintaining state on a webpage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cookies are small pieces of information that are:
				<ul>
					<li>Sent from a website</li>
					<li>Stored on the visitors hard drive by the user's web browser</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Cookies are usesd to differentiate among users and personalise websites

				They are used to:
				<ul>
					<li>Remember stateful information (e.g. items added into a shopping cart), manage the shopping cart,
						personalise aspects of websites</li>
					<li>Record the user's browsing activity (e.g. clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording
						which pages were visited in the past) - website statistics and creation of anonymous user
						profiles</li>
					<li>Remember arbitrary pieces of information previously entered (e.g. names, addresses, passwords,
						and credit card numbers) - knows if the user is already logged in</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				This practical all about cookies allowed us to create a web form for a username/password and using the
				mylibrary.js functions to remember user input/userchoices.
			</p>
			<p>
				On load, the form asks the user to register, and if the user does put in a username/password and clicks
				remember password, then we store the information in cookies using the makeCookies() function Jane
				provided us with.
			</p>
			<p>
				This form can be seen <a href="practical3\practical15_q1.html">practical3_q1.html</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				The second form for this webpage was a background colour selector that would remember the users
				preferences using cookies. The user could reset this selection by pressing a button that would delete
				all cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I ran into some problems when developing as Google Chrome does not store cookies on local files and so I
				spent quite some time debugging before realising that was the issue - so because of this these forms
				will need to be run in Internet Explorer to work as intended.

		<!-- Week 4 -->
		<div id="week4">

			<h1>Week 4</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>

				Week 4 we began to look at the jQuery library, this is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that is
				designed to change the way that you write JavaScript
			</p>
			<p>

				It offers some different functionality from plain JavaScript
				<ul>
					<li>DOM scripting & event handling</li>
					<li>Ajax</li>
					<li>User interface effects</li>
					<li>Form validation</li>
					<li>Utilities</li>
				</ul>

				It is lightweight, supports multiple browsers, has a CSS-like syntax, an active developer community
				supporting the library and is extensible.
			</p>
			<p>
				jQuery can be downloaded from the website <a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a> or it can
				be linked to from external sources such as
				<ul>
					<li><a
							href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js">https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js</a>
					</li>
					<li><a
							href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js">http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Selecting a part of the document is a fundamental part of jQuery. <br>
				a jQuery object is a wrapper for a selected group of DOM nodes <br>

				$() function is a factory method that creates JQuery objects <br>
				$(a) is a JQuery object containing all the a elements in the document
			</p>

			<p>
				$ is nothing but a shorthand notation for find method in JQuery. You can also use jQuery('' '') instead
				of $('' '')
			</p>

			<p>
				<h3>Practical</h3>

				<p>
					For the practical we were asked to download jQuery from <a href="jquery.com">jQuery.com</a> and the
					2 example HTML documents provided.
				</p>

				<p>Once we had looked at Jane's code and began to understand how jQuery worked, we moved onto the second
					task.</p>

				<p>
					This task was to take some more code and add our own jQuery statement to it in order to change a
					paragraph of text from "This is paragraph 1" to "Hello there" through calling a function called
					<i>"selectElement"</i> &mdash; this is a built in function to jQuery.

		<!-- Week 5 -->
		<div id="week5">

			<h1>Week 5</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				This week began with Jane telling us about our group project scenarios, and how we should go about
				creating the project e.g. what steps we should take.
			</p>

			<p>
				Then the main content for the lecture was jQuery part 2 - we looked at some more functions within
				jQuery.

				<ul>
					<li>jQuery() = $()</li>
					<li>$(function) The “Ready” handler</li>
					<li>$(‘selector’) Element selector expression</li>
					<li>$(element) Specify element(s) directly</li>
					<li>$(‘HTML’) HTML creation</li>
					<li>$.function() Execute a jQuery function</li>
					<li>$.fn.myfunc(){ } Create jQuery function</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				We were then given a large list from w3schools which contained all of the jQuery selectors.
			</p>

			<p>
				The lecture also showed us that jQuery can be used to create visual effects for example
				.slideUp("slow").
			</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>

			<p>
				The practical this week was working on improving examples from the lecture using the jQuery we learned.

			</p>
			<p>
				The first one was a counting the number of checked checkboxes using the .length method in jQuery, for
				the second question
				we then just modified this to work with select list of options rather than radio buttons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Question 3 and 4 related to 1 and 2 whereby it was modifying the code to check what the user had
				selected and e.g. tell them
				if we were on the same course (question 3) or else repeat the options they had selected (question 4).

		<!-- Week 6 -->
		<div id="week6">

			<h1>Week 6</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				This week we looked at how to select all elements of a certain type, for example all img tags, or all
				elements with the same attribute.
			</p>
			<p>
				This can be done through using <br>
				<i>$(selector).each</i> <br>
				And then you can apply a function to each of these elements through using <br>
				<i>$(selector).each(function) {</i> <br>

			</p>
			<p>
				For example, to get the attrivutes of all image alt tags you could use: <br>
				<i>

					function getAlt(){ <br>
					$("img").each(function(m){ <br>
					alert(this.alt); <br>
					}); <br>
					} <br>

				</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				After this we looked at how you could select a subset of elements using the selector.slice(start, end)
				method.
			</p>
			<p>
				This selects a subset of the matched elements. Starting from the 'start', to 'end' but excludes the
				'end'.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example: <br>
				<i>
					$(document).ready(function() {<br>
					$("li").slice(2, 5).addClass("selected");<br>
					});<br>
				</i>
				Will add the class "selected" to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th list items.
			</p>
			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>
				In this weeks practical we used the examples from the lecture to create our own webpages with similar
				scenarios.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first question wanted us to create functions to zoom in/zoom out 4 images with the click of a
				button, this was done by selecting each img element and increasing the width/height by 20%.
				<br>
				Secondly, we created 2 buttons: 1 to move to the next image set, and one to move back to the original
				again. This was achieved through a loop and selecting each img element.
			</p>
			<a href="practical6/practical6_q2.html">practical6_q2.html</a>
			<p>
				Next was an example of the .slice method where upon clicking a text link the div blocks 3-6 (exclusive)
				would change background colour.

		<!-- Week 7 -->
		<div id="week7">

			<h1>Week 7</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>In the Lecture this week we looked at Jquery with events, we looked at first how Jquery works with events
				to find it allos them to attach multiple event handlers to page elements and use standard names</p>
			<p>We looked at different event objects e.g</p>
			<li>Event Contructor - new jquery.Event</li>
			<li>Event Trigger - jquery("body").trigger(e)</li>
			<li>Event Handler</li>
			<p>We also looked at the different event methods that could exist in certain methods theses consist of:</p>
			<li>preventDefault()</li>
			<li>isDefaultPrevented()</li>
			<li>blind(), blur(),change(),click(),dbclick()</li>
			<li>focus(),hover(), load(), submit()</li>
			<li>on(),ready(),resize()</li>
			<br>
			<p>We looked at binding an event handler to an event next within the lecture, this required using the on()
				method in order to attach the handler.</p>
			<p>The full event handler to be used would be $(selector).on( events [, selector] [, data], handler)</p>
			<p>After looking at this we began to look at examples on how to bind these using the event methods.
				Alongside this we looked at multi-binding to which an event can be bound more than once. </p>
			<p>An important note we learnt was that the on() method will only run once so after it has it wil become
				unbound.</p>
			<p>To do this you need to use the unbind event which will then remove the earlier handler, "unbound"</p>
			<br>
			<p>To finish the lecture we then looked at many other examples including those showing us how to:</p>
			<li>Get the event type</li>
			<li>Getting mouse click coordinates</li>
			<li>Other on() examples.</li>

			<br>
			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>In this practical we completed some tasks to follow what we learned in the lecture about the Jquery
				Events, the first task asked us to create mouseover events. The result of this should be when the mouse
				is placed over the link that a message will appear at the top of the screen to alert the user.</p>


			<p>The next part of the practical was to expand on this and include jpeg images so that when the mouse is
				placed over the existing image it will change to another image.</p>

			<h3>Group Work</h3>
			<p>The first part of the practical was to continue on with our group work we had a meeting on Tuesday to
				discuss progress in the group. The minutes of the meeting can be found below.</p>

		<!-- Week 8 -->
		<div id="week8">

			<h1>Week 8</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>We had no class this week due to it being a reading day</p>

		</div>
		<hr>


		<!-- Week 9 -->
		<div id="week9">
			<h1>Week 9</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>This week we began to look at AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML which allows us to
				update pages without the need to refresh the page in the browser all the time. When using AJAX the thing
				to take in account is the XMLHttpRequest object which you can structure with data that you wish to send
				out, set data up with a call back function and connect to the server.</p>

			<p>The load() function loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element</p>
			<pre>
					$(document).ready(function(){
						$("button").click(function(){
						  $("div").load('test1.txt');
						});
					  });
				</pre>
			<p>The ready() function waits for the dom to be loaded, then runs the function. The click() function waits
				for the selected element to be clicked, in this case, a button. Finally the load() function loads the
				file test1.txt into the selected element "div" when the button is clicked, after the DOM is ready.</p>

			<pre>
					$(document).ready(function(){
						$("button").click(function(){
						  $.ajax({url:"test1.txt", success:function(result){
							$("div").html(result);
						  }});
						});
					  });
				</pre>

			<h3>Group Work</h3>
			<p>First part of this practical was to continue with the group work, our group has been working well and we
				have discussed to try and finish the website as soon as possible so that we are not rushed when the
				deadline appears.</p>
			<p>We continued to have meetings and record what was discussed and what progress we will be making in the
				last few weeks as the deadline is the 5th of April.</p>

		<!-- Week 10 -->
		<div id="week10">
			<h1>Week 10</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>In this weeks lecture we looked at jQuery UI elements which consisted of date pickers and draggable
				elements.</p>
			<p>We first looked at how to start when using jQuery UI which consisted of three main steps:</p>
			<li>Download the builder- version 1.12.1</li>
			<li>Using jQuery UI on a webpage: Include the jQuery, UI and CSS</li>
			<li>And add jQuery widgets</li>
			<br>
			<p>We then began to look at examples, the first one was the date picker to which we looked at the code
				behind this that allows it to execute without faults</p>
			<p>The second example wass the draggable and this would be then later included in our practical so it wass
				important to pay attention to this as we would be asked later in the practical to expand among this and
				create other features</p>
			<p>This lecture was difficult to understand because it was new to us but would become clearer once we did
				complete the practicals later in the week</p>

			<h3>Practical</h3>
			<p>In the first part of this practical we had to modify the example webpage given to us so that it could
				also have a draggable area along the X-Axis</p>

			<p>The final part of the practical included different format as it included images to which my program used
				fruit pictures that would be able to be dragged and dropped into the area created</p>

		<!-- Week 11 -->
		<div id="week11">
			<h1>Week 11</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>In this weeks lecture we looked at jQuery Utility and Miscellaneous functions</p>
			<p>We first began by looking at the different utility functions these consisted of:</p>
			<li>$.trim( )</li>
			<li>$.each( )</li>
			<li>$.inArray( )</li>
			<li>$.extend( ) </li>
			<li>$.proxy</li>
			<br>
			<p>We then moved on to look at the different miscellaneous methods that consist of:</p>
			<li>$.data( ) ; </li>
			<li>$.removeData( )</li>
			<li>$.get( )</li>
			<li>$.index( ) </li>
			<li>$size( )</li>
			<li>$.toArray( )</li>
			<li>jQuery.noConflict( )</li>
			<br>
			<p>We then began to look in detail into some of the functions and methods as to what they do and how they
				are written within a webpage.</p>
			<p>We finished the lecture by looking at the other utility methods not mentioned previously that included:
			</p>
			<li>.size( )</li>
			<li>trim()</li>
			<li>.now()</li>
			<li>.isNumeric(); isFunction(); isPlainObject()…</li>
			<li>.isArray(), .inArray(), .makeArray(), .merge()…</li>
			<li>.extend()</li>
			<li>.parseJSON(), .parseXML()</li>


			<h3>Practical</h3>



		</div>
		<hr>
		<!-- Week 12 -->
		<div id="week12">
			<h1>Week 12</h1>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>In this weeks lecture we looked at jQuery Plugins, we began with finding out what it actually is which
				is: A new method that we use to extend jQuery's prototype object.
				By extending the prototype object you enable all jQuery objects to inherit any methods that you add.</p>
			<p>W looked at how to:</p>
			<li>Create Plugins</li>
			<li>Basic Plugin Authoring</li>
			<li>Chaining</li>
			<li>Protecting the $ Alias and Adding Scope</li>
			<li>Use own private variable</li>
			<li>writing plugins to only take up one slot within $.fn</li>
			<li>How to use each method -- collection</li>
			<li>And finally how to put them together</li>
			<br>
			<p>To finish the lecture we then looked at a summary of what we have learned over the last 2 semesters and
				reflected on the work we had completed.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Practical</h3>

			<p>In the practical today we were creating plugins, we first had to create a new Jquery library called
				Greenify.js</p>
			<p>We then moved onto the first task which was to Create a jQuery html file, and include the greenify.js. In
				this jQuery html body section, create some href links, then in the head section within the script block,
				use the greenify plugin to display the links in green</p>

			<p>Next we had to add a paragraph of text to the html above and display the text in green using the greenify
				plugin</p>
