<h1>Week 8</h1>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Week 8's lecture was titled form validation and covered how to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use form validation to examine text</li>
    <li>Understand the princiuples of working with text fields</li>
    <li>Detect and change the format of information in a text field</li>
    <li>Work with radio buttons, check boxes, and selection menus</li>
    <li>Create simple, self grading tests</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different types of form validation, including: valid email address, valid date, valid text type and leaving required fields empty</p>
<p>We should remind the visitor to enter missing data and reformat the visitor's data as needed</p>

<h3>Practical</h3>
<p>The initial question wanted the use of loops to create a table of multiplcations, with as many rows/columns as the user wished</p>

<p>Then we needed to modify the script to be able to search for a specific value, and then tell the user which row/column it was situated in</p>

<p>Once these were complete we started building an insurance quote checker form which used the following criteria</p>
<ul>
    <li>if the age is above 30 (include 30) and married, the car insurance is ‘class 1’;</li>
    <li>if the age is above 30 (include 30) and single, the car insurance is  ‘class 2’;</li>
    <li>if the age is above 21 and below 30,  married, the car insurance is  ‘class 3’; </li>
    <li>if the age is above 21 and below 30, single, the car insurance is  ‘class 4’; and></li>
    <li>if the age is above 17 and below 21, the car insurance is ‘class 5’</li>
</ul>

<p>The final question asked for us to modify the script to validate the form before submitting it. To do this part of the practical
    I did some personal research into how to achieve the required validation neccessary and found you can use "regular expression"
    in JavaScript to check for things like alphabetical characters only.
</p>
<p>For the age, I used an input type of number so only numbers can be input - this was added in HTML5</p>
